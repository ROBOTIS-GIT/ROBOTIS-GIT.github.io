The Dynamixel can protect itself by detecting dangerous situations that could occur during the operation.  
Each Bit is inclusively processed with the ‘OR’ logic, therefore, multiple options can be generated.  
For instance, when ‘0x05’ (binary : 00000101) is defined in [Shutdown(63)], Dynamixel can detect both Input Voltage Error(binary : 00000001) and Overheating Error(binary : 00000100).  
If those errors are detected, [Torque Enable(64)] is cleared to ‘0’ and the motor output becomes 0[%].  
REBOOT is the only method to reset [Torque Enable(64)] to ‘1’(Torque ON) after the shutdown.  
The followings are detectable situations.

{% capture control_table_shutdown %}
**NOTE** : If Shutdown occurs, use below method to reboot Dynamixels.
1. H/W REBOOT : Turn off the power and turn on again
2. S/W REBOOT : Transmit REBOOT Instruction (For more details, please refer to the [Reboot](/docs/en/dxl/protocol2/#reboot) section of Protocol e-Manual.)
