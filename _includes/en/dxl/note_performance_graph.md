**NOTE** : The max torque measurement method for the Stall Torque and Performance Graph is different. Stall torque is measured from the max torque that it can reach. This is generally how RC servos measure their torque. For the Performance graph with the N-T curves, it is measured with the load gradually increasing. The motor operation environment is closer to the performance graph, not stall torque method. This is probably why the performance graph is being broadly used in the industrial market. This is why the max torque of the performance grap can actually be less than the stall torque.

**CAUTION : When supplying power**  
- It is recommended using ROBOTIS controller or SMPS2DYNAMIXEL.
- Do not connect or disconnect DYNAMIXEL when power is being supplied.
