# [Machine Learning](#machine-learning)
Machine learning is a data analysis technique that teaches computers to recognize what is natural for people and animals - learning through experience. There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning. 

This application is reinforcement learning with DQN (Deep Q-Learning). The reinforcement learning is concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

This shows reinforcement learning with TurtleBot3 in gazebo. 
This reinforcement learning is applied DQN(Deep Q-Learning) algorithm with LDS.  
We are preparing a four-step reinforcement learning tutorial.

## [Step. 1 (No Obstacle)](#step-1-no-obstacle)
- (Coming soon!)

## [Step. 2 (Static Obstacle)](#step-2-static-obstacle)
- (Coming soon!)

## [Step. 3 (Moving Obstacle)](#step-3-moving-obstacle)
- (Coming soon!)

## [Step. 4 (Combination Obstacle)](#step-4-combination-obstacle)
- (Coming soon!)
