### [SBC setup](#sbc-setup)

#### Download and Install Ubuntu Image File

**WARNING** : Do not proceed to this instruction on SBC in TurtleBot3. Please follow steps with **Remote PC**.
{: .notice--warning}

1. Go on [Ubuntu releases](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases/bionic/release) to download an image file.
2. Download `Raspberry Pi 3 (64-bit ARM) preinstalled server image` on **remote PC**
3. Burn the image file to a microSD card.

**TIP** : You can use `GNOME Disks` to burn `Ubuntu Server 18.04 image` to microSD.
{: .notice}

#### Initialization Process for Raspberry Pi 3

**WARNING** : Do not proceed to this instruction on **remote PC**. Please follow steps with **SBC in TurtleBot3**.
{: .notice--warning}

To communicate between **remote PC** and **TurtleBot3**, install `Ubuntu Server 18.04 image` file on Raspberry Pi 3.
1. Boot up Raspberry Pi 3 after insert a microSD card which has the image file into a microSD card slot on SBC in TurtleBot3.  
  (You can connect HDMI cable, keyboard and mouse into the TurtleBot3)
2. Log in with default username(`ubuntu`) and password(`ubuntu`).  
  (After log in, system will ask you whether you change the password or not)
3. You can configure WiFi network setting by utilizing a [netplan](https://netplan.io/). Refer to [Example for Netwrok Configuration](#example-for-network-configuration).

**NOTE** : TurtleBot3 is a mobile robot to run [SLAM](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/slam/#slam) and [Navigation](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/navigation/#navigation) using wireless network, so that connecting TurtleBot3 to WIFI is recommanded.
{: .notice}

#### Example for Network Configuration


1. Create a folder, and then open it with the following commands.
  ```bash
  $ sudo touch /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
  $ sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
  ```
2. After opening the file, configure a network setting. Refer to the network setting below.
```yaml
network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
      eth0:
        dhcp4: yes
        dhcp6: yes
        optional: true
    wifis:
      wlan0:
        dhcp4: yes
        dhcp6: yes
        access-points:
          "your-wifi-name":
            password: "your-wifi-password"
```

3. After Configuration, remote PC can connect to a SBC in TurtleBot3 by following steps.

4. Apply all configuration for the renderers, and then restart Raspberry Pi 3.
```bash
$ sudo netplan apply
```

5. Set the systemed to prevent boot-up delay even if there is no network at startup. Run a command below to set mask the systemd process using the following command.
```bash
$ systemctl mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
```

6. From now, you can use SSH. If you want remote PC to connect to SBC and to install ROS and TurtleBot3 software, run a command below.
```bash
$ ssh ubuntu@<NETWORK IP of Raspberry PI>
```

#### Add swap space

1. Create a file while it will be used for swap
```bash
$ sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
```

2. Give `read` and `write` permissions to the file
```bash
$ sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```

3. Use `mkswap` to set up a Linux swap area. 
```bash
$ sudo mkswap /swapfile
```

4. After creating a file, activate the file to start using it. 
```bash
$ sudo swapon /swapfile
```

5. Open `/etc/fstab` file with `nano` command, as swap areas are listed in `/etc/fastab`.
```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

6. Copy a sentence below, then paste it the file you opened.
```
/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0
```

7. Verify swap area with `free` syntax whether it is allocated. It will present a table consisting of six colums and three rows of data. 
```bash
$ sudo free -h
```

#### Intall ROS 2 Dashing Diademata

**WARNING** : Do not proceed to this instruction on **remote PC**. Please follow steps with **SBC in TurtleBot3**.
{: .notice--warning}

As TurtleBot3 operates on Robot Operating System(ROS), it requies to intall `ROS 2 Dashing Diademata` on Ubuntu installed in **SBC of TurtleBot3**. Following link will guide you for installing ROS 2.

- [ROS 2 Installation Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/Linux-Install-Debians/)

1. Update and upgrade your software
```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
1. Setup locale
```bash
$ sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
$ sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
$ export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```
1. Setup sources
```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-latest.list'
```
1. Install ROS 2 packages
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ros-dashing-ros-base
```

#### Install TurtleBot3 Packages

**WARNING** : Do not proceed to this instruction on remote PC. Please follow steps with **SBC in TurtleBot3**.
{: .notice--warning}

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-argcomplete python3-colcon-common-extensions libboost-system-dev
$ mkdir -p ~/turtlebot3_ws/src && cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src

#### Environment Setup

##### Domain ID Allocation
In DDS communication, `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` must be matched between **remote PC** and **TurtleBot3** for wireless communication under the same network environment. Following commands shows how to assign a `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` to SBC in TurtleBot3.
- A default ID of **TurtleBot3** is set as `0`.  
- To configure the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` of Remote PC and SBC in TurtleBot3 to `30` is recommendable.  

```bash
$ echo 'source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30 #TURTLEBOT3' >> ~/.bashrc

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping)** is a technique to draw a map by estimating current location in an arbitrary space. The SLAM is a well-known feature of TurtleBot from its predecessors. The video here shows you how accurately TurtleBot3 can draw a map with its compact and affordable platform.

1. Lauch `turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py`
```bash
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py
```
    ![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/ros2/platform_cartographer.png)
2. Save the map
```bash
$ ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver -f ~/map
```

## [Navigation2](#navigation2)

**Navigation** is to move a robot from one location to the specified destination in a given environment. For this purpose, a map that contains geometry information of furniture, objects, and walls of the given environment is required. As described in the previous [Cartographer](/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2/#cartographer) section, the map was created with the distance information obtained by the sensor and the pose information of the robot itself.

**Navigation** enables a robot to move from the current pose to the designated goal pose on the map by using the map, robot’s encoder, IMU sensor, and distance sensor. The procedure for performing this task is as follows.
